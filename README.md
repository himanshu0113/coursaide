# Mobile Computing – Project Description

Vision: To design a TA management and Course-Selection application that helps resolve time-table based conflicts for students of IIIT-Delhi.

Features: The application will provide user profiles for students, and a separate profile for system admins. 
User Profile

# Student Profile

Create Profile: The student will be asked to provide details such as Name, Roll Number, Subjects Completed, Semester Number, and Specialisation. A login password will be generated, and can be changed by the user on first login (or any subsequent login). The username will be the same as the Roll Number, and hence unique. A basic security requirement is that one roll number can only be used to make one profile. 
Course Selection: The system will help the user (student) decide possible combinations of courses that can be chosen in a particular semester to satisfy the personal requirements of the user.

Input
Credit Requirement: 12
Specialisation Credits required (if applicable): 4

Output
Combination 1: Course 1, Course 2, Course 3 – Personal Time Table
Combination 2: Course 1, Course 2, Course 3 – Personal Time Table
